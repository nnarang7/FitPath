        We are four female hackers who happened to be roommates called “The Fiercest Roomates Ever.” We hail from diverse backgrounds and geographic locations, brought together at the University of Pennsylvania by a love of Computer Science and technology. Every day, we attempt to balance our hectic schedules with a need to stay healthy and fit, hence the development of RouteEx. RouteEx embodies our desire to apply the fundamental CS skills we’ve learned in class with our wish to help our peers. We plan to continue developing such “hacks” throughout our CS careers.
